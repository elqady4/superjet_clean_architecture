# superjet_clean_architecture

![image](https://github.com/elqady4/suberjet_clean_architecture/blob/main/screen%20shots/travel%20app.jpg?raw=true)

The project is written using the Clean Architecture pattern, which divides the code into three layers: data, domain, and presentation. The data layer interacts with the data sources, the domain layer contains the business logic of the application, and the presentation layer handles the user interface. The project also uses cubit as a state management solution, which helps to keep the state of the app in a consistent and predictable state. The project is also responsive, which means that it can be used on different screen sizes. The project uses Firebase as a backend service to store data and API to get data from external sources.
